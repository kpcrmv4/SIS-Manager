 * Page title + the page's own primary action.

 * THE ACTION IS A PROP. Do not wrap `<PageHeader>` in another flex row to put a
 * button beside it — the header already owns that layout, and wrapping it makes
 * every other element in the header (theme toggle, bell, whatever the shell
 * puts there) jump to the wrong side. Anything global belongs in the top bar,
 * which every page has; only the action that belongs to THIS page comes here.
 *
 * Space above the title is always greater than space below it, so the title
 * binds to its own content instead of floating between two sections.

        `shrink-0` keeps a Thai button label from being squeezed until it breaks
        mid-syllable — but `shrink-0` ALONE overflows the page when a header
        carries several buttons, and `overflow-x: clip` then eats the last one
        with no scrollbar to reveal it. Measured: a four-button header was 401px
        wide on a 390px screen and the rightmost button was simply gone.
        `max-w-full` + `flex-wrap` makes them wrap instead of vanish.
